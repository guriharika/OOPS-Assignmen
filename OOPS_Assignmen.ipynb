        "**1. Modularity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* OOP allows the software to be broken down into smaller, manageable modules (objects or classes). Each module is self-contained, meaning you can work on one part of the system without affecting others.\n",
        "\n",
        "* This leads to better code organization and easier debugging.\n",
